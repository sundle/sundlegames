<h3>Advice for writers (narrative designers) trying to break into the world of gaming.</h3>

<p>First thing to know, is that writers are called narrative designers in the games industry.

</p><p>Designing Games by Tynan Sylvester is a good book for learning a about game narratives and game design.  His indie game hit, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/294100/RimWorld/">RimWorld</a>, is a textbook example of generating stories, or creating a story making machine.

</p><p>Instead of trying to program games yourself, I'd recommend joining <a href="https://itch.io/jams">game jam teams</a>. There are an increasing number of narrative heavy games being released for these and they definitely stand out. Game jam entries are very short indies, are typically made in 2-7 days, and there's lots of feedback. So, you can quickly learn a lot and build up a portfolio. You may even find yourself partaking in a successful game.  This is not unheard of as game journalists can often pay attention to jams, especially their favourite ones.

</p><p>People often describe awful writing jobs at large companies. These game jams are usually the opposite, a small group of people willing to experiment and try all kinds of stuff out. As a writer, you'll be a unique member and should be able to get quite a say in various decisions, especially if you learn a little about game design.

</p><p>You can check out examples of narrative heavy games by browsing top entries to previous story based game jams like <a href="https://itch.io/jam/mystery-game-jam-2024">Mystery Game Jam</a> and <a href="https://itch.io/jam/narrative-design-24">Narrative Design Award Jam</a>.  I myself tried my hand at making one, called <a href="https://sundle.itch.io/swipe-stream">Swipe Stream</a>.
